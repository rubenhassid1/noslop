  Makes or fixes Claude artifacts (updates, briefs, memos, dashboards, guides, pitches,
  tools) so someone with zero context gets them in 5 seconds: always HTML, the form picked
  from the reader's job, visuals instead of text, a header that says what it is, plain
  sentences, every detail kept, and Claude's own look. Use whenever you make an artifact or
  page someone else will read, or when asked to fix, clean up or deslop one.

# No slop.

Claude: you were sent here to make an artifact, or to fix one. Follow this page. You need nothing else from this repo.

**Always build an HTML artifact.** Never a Claude Doc, a plain document or a long chat reply: those read like a message, not like something you send your boss.

## 1. Know the reader and the job

Before you build, you need three answers:

1. Who reads it, and what do they already know? Assume nothing.
2. What should they do after: decide, catch up, keep checking, learn, say yes, or use it?
3. Will they read it once, or come back to it?

If the request doesn't answer them, ask as clickable questions. Ask nothing else. Then build.

If it all fits in a 5-line message, say so, and write the message instead.

## 2. Pick the form from the job

The job decides the form. Never use one look for everything.

| The reader needs to… | Build | It looks like |
|---|---|---|
| Decide (memo, brief, proposal to a boss) | A decision page | The ask and the deadline on top. Each option as a card, side by side, the one you recommend marked. Costs as bars. Risks as a short list. |
| Catch up (weekly or monthly update) | A report | The 3 or 4 numbers that matter as tiles, each with its change since last time in green or red. One chart. The decisions you need as cards. Then what happened. |
| Keep checking (tracker, dashboard) | A dashboard | Number tiles on top. Each section in its own card. Status as colored pills. One chart per question. |
| Learn or follow steps (guide, process, onboarding) | A step-by-step guide | All the steps as a visual path on top. One step per screen, with Back and Next. Each step draws what the reader will see (the screen, the button) and gives every rule, amount and deadline that applies. |
| Say yes (pitch, proposal, plan for a group) | Slides | One idea per slide. Each slide is one big visual (a number, a chart, a before and after, a diagram) and one sentence. Arrow keys and buttons. The last slide is the ask. |
| Use it (calculator, planner, checklist) | A tool | Fits one screen. Inputs on the left, the answer big on the right. Works on sample data from the first second. |
| Keep it (cheat sheet, reference) | A one-page sheet | Cards grouped by topic, each with an icon and a header. Each item is a bold keyword and one short line. Warnings in red. Fits one screen. |

When a job mixes two, lead with the main one.

## 3. Design rules

1. **Show it, don't write it. This is rule number one.** Visuals carry the message. Words only label them. Every section starts with a visual: a big number, a bar or line chart, a timeline, a path of steps, cards side by side, a drawn screen, an icon. If a section is only sentences, turn it into a visual. Test: hide every paragraph. The page should still make sense.
2. **The top says what you're looking at.** The first thing on the page is a header line: what this is, who it's from, who it's for, the date, and what you need from them. Example: `Monthly update · October 2026 · From Sam to Dana · 3 decisions before Monday`. Under it, a title that says the point. At most one line under the title, and only to say what to do.
3. **Normal sentences.** Write every title, heading and label the way you'd say it to a colleague: "4 candidates have no interview date yet", not "Waiting with no date". No clever, punchy or poetic phrases. No subtitle under each heading.
4. **Simple is not empty.** Use simple words, but keep every detail the reader needs to act: amounts, limits, dates, names, who approves, exceptions, examples, links. A guide lets someone do the whole thing without asking anyone. A policy or a process shows its owner, its start date and who to ask. Every number that changed says what it's compared to: "+$1,043 vs September", never "+$1,043".
5. **No walls of text.** 2 lines per paragraph at most. 10 words per table cell at most. More than 6 rows of sentences? Split them into cards by topic. Bold the word that matters in each line.
6. **Look like Claude.** People already know Claude's look, so a new one makes them work. Use the style kit below: Claude's colors, its 2 fonts, its cards and its buttons. Claude's clay is the only accent, for the main button and the one thing to look at. Green, red and amber only mean good, bad and watch.
7. **One place to start.** The biggest thing on the screen is the most important thing. The eye knows where to go first, second, third. Never one long scroll: past 2 screens, use tabs, steps or slides.

## 4. Slop signs

Never ship a page with these:

- Paragraphs and bullet lists where a number, a chart or a diagram would show it.
- No header: the reader can't tell what this is, who sent it, or why.
- Clever headings ("Candidates in play", "The road ahead") instead of plain sentences.
- A subtitle or helper text under every heading.
- Stripped bare: no amounts, rules, exceptions or examples, so it doesn't look important.
- Walls of text: long paragraphs, tables full of sentences, a dozen rows that look the same.
- A change with nothing to compare it to: "+12%" instead of "+12% vs September".
- A row of identical cards, each with its own little chart. Use one main chart, with plain numbers around it.
- A look that isn't Claude's: blue buttons, new fonts, many text sizes, gradients, emoji as icons.
- One long scroll that tries to hold everything.
- Badges, pills or numbers (01, 02, 03) that carry no information.

## 5. Fixing an artifact

You got a page: a link, a file, code or a screenshot. First list the slop signs you find, one line each. Then decide how much to change:

- **Lots of slop, or the wrong form for the job:** rebuild it in the right form, following this whole page.
- **A few signs on a page that mostly works:** fix only those, and keep its layout.
- **No slop:** say so. Suggest at most 3 small changes, and change nothing unless they say yes.

Keep every fact, number and name. Add nothing new. When you're done, say in one line what you changed.

## 6. Check before you show it

Read it as the person from step 1, with zero context:

- Hide the paragraphs. Do the visuals alone tell the story?
- Does the top say what this is, who it's from, and what they need to do?
- Read every heading out loud. Is it a normal sentence?
- Is every detail there that they need to act without asking anyone?
- Does every change say what it's compared to?
- Does it look like Claude?
- Could they forward it to their own boss without explaining anything?

If any answer is no, fix it first.

## 7. Style kit

Start every page from this. Add only what the page needs.

- **Fonts:** serif for the title and section headings, like Claude's greeting. Sans for everything else.
- **Sizes:** only 5. 40px big numbers, 32px title, 22px section headings, 16px text, 13px labels.
- **Charts:** inline SVG or Chart.js. The bar or line that matters in clay, the rest in gray.
- **Icons:** simple line icons drawn in SVG, in gray or clay. Never emoji.
